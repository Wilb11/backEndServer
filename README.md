We are creating a website that helps you plan out a trip. Each user will input what type of weather they want in their place of travel and the dates they want to travel. Our application will factor in the weather in the area for the dates you want to go and also the flight price for flying to that area and give suggestions for where you should travel. 

Database: Require users to store profile information in the database
Also to be used as a cache

API’s: Weather App, Google Flights
3rd Party OAuth: Log in with Google

Decoupled Architecture: Hosting: Firebase, Frontend: JS, Backend:TBD
